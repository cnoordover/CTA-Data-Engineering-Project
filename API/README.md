# CTA "Locations API"
This project uses one of the three public APIs that the CTA publishes (Arrivals, Follow This Train, Locations)

The Locations API provides the location (in lat and lon) of every train in the CTA system

Additional information provided by Locations API: next station, final destination, run number, route color
