# CTA-Serverless-Data-Engineering-Project
Fully automated data engineering pipeline that ingests real-time Chicago Transit Authority's (CTA) "L-train" data into AWS services, with seamless integration into Grafana for downstream visualization.
## Objective
To track and visualize the location and destination of all of the CTA's train's throughout the Chicagoland area. This will enable riders to more efficiently and effectively plan their travel. Long-term storage of the data will also enable future analysis on the most efficient routes, stations, and runs on the system.
